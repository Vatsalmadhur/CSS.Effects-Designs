        <h2>Air</h2>
        <p>
          Airbending is the bending art used by the Air Nomads; the flying bison
          were the original airbenders. It concentrates on speed and evasion,
          forgoing a strong offense for a greater defense. Though apparently
          lacking fatal finishing moves, it is the most dynamic of all the
          bending arts. As the element of freedom, airbenders use their
          capability to bend unencumbered by the ground or any other
          environmental factors and use their own momentum as a weapon, evading
          attacks with astounding agility to tire their opponents out or
          building up massive inertia for explosive gusts of wind to make their
          counterattacks finishing moves. When resorting to physical
          confrontation, airbenders are able to harness the immense, intangible
          power of wind.Airbenders can use a flight technique by operating a
          glider and using the air to provide thrust and lift. Airbending's
          opposite is earthbending and the confrontational style that serves as
          its foundation.The sub-skills of airbending are flight and spiritual
          projection. Flight has only been achieved by two people in the entire
          history of airbending, namely Guru Laghima and Zaheer, while spiritual
          projection is only known to have been achieved by Jinora. Airbending
          is the element of freedom, and its season is fall.

        <h2>Water</h2>
        <p>
          Waterbending is practiced by some people of the Water Tribe. A
          versatile element, it is unique in the sense that the original bender
          of the element was not an animal, but rather the Moon.Similar to their
          element, waterbenders are extremely adaptable and versatile.
          Waterbending concentrates on the flow of energy, focusing less on
          strength and more on turning the opponent's own energy against them.
          While a bender's victory in battle depends on their skill or
          ingenuity, waterbenders gain a serious advantage or disadvantage
          depending on the amount of water around them, although highly skilled
          waterbenders can draw water from anywhere, such as draw humidity from
          the air and bend the water in living things, especially plants.As the
          element of change, waterbenders can fluidly and quickly alternate from
          defense to offense, from a wall of ice to a jet of water, turning
          their opponent's strength against them. Due to its lunar sympathy,
          waterbending is stronger at night and ineffective during a lunar
          eclipse or when the Moon Spirit dies. However, to counter
          waterbending's ineffectiveness during a lunar eclipse, waterbenders
          gain immense power during the peak of the full moon. The opposite of
          waterbending is firebending, with its relatively stagnant, direct
          philosophy. The sub-skills for waterbending are healing and
          bloodbending.Waterbending is the element of change, and its season is
          winter.

        <h2>Earth</h2>
        <p>
          Earthbending originates in the Earth Kingdom and the first
          earthbenders were badgermoles. It demands a special connection with
          the earth that is achievable with neutral jing, listening, though
          seemingly doing nothing and waiting for the right moment to strike.
          Like waterbenders, earthbenders gain an advantage or disadvantage in
          battle based on the amount of earth around them, though the conditions
          are not as extreme. Because of their element's stability and its
          stress on neutral jing, earthbenders stand their ground, absorbing or
          intercepting attacks until they completely overwhelm their
          opponents.Unlike the other bending arts, earthbending's strength
          equally lies in both offense and defense. Earthbending is in stark
          contrast to airbending as airbending's emphasis is on evasion and
          mobility while earthbending's emphasis is on fortitude and strength.
          The sub-skills for earthbending are seismic sense, metalbending, and
          lavabending.Earthbending is the element of substance, and its season
          is spring.

        <h2>Fire</h2>
        <p>
          Firebending is used by the people of the Fire Nation and is the most
          aggressive bending art. Dragons were the first firebenders; they
          subsequently taught the Sun Warriors. For a long time, disciplines of
          firebending were taught to be fueled by hatred, as opposed to the
          original source. As the element of power, firebenders have to be able
          to maintain a constant source of energy and balance in battle,
          unleashing a volley of direct, successive attacks. Unlike other
          benders who depend on external sources of their elements to bend,
          firebenders can create fire using their internal heat source in
          addition to controlling already existent flames. Skilled firebenders
          are able to fly using powerful jets of flames. Due to its solar
          affinity, firebending is stronger during the day and at its full power
          at noon, but completely ineffective during a solar eclipse. When a
          comet passes close to the planet, the power of a firebender is greatly
          increased. Firebending's relatively simple and direct style contrasts
          with the changing style of waterbending. A notable feature of special
          firebenders is the ability to create a hotter, blue fire; Azula was
          the only known firebender who demonstrated this extra-powerful flame.
          The sub-skills for firebending are combustionbending, generating and
          redirecting lightning. Firebending is the element of power, and its
          season is summer.
